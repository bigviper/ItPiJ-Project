Introduction to Programming in Java - Pascal's Triangle - Laboratory Project

#commit 1
The project must be kept in a Model - View - Controller design pattern.
There should be 2 methods of Pascal's triangle construction:
- Binomial coefficients method
- Parent nodes summation method
After the program's  correct operation, the execution times of the methods should be compared.
